# Deepfake simple
DeepFake Detection is the problem of recognizing false movies or pictures created using deep learning algorithms. Deepfakes are made by employing machine learning algorithms to edit or replace components of an original video or picture, such as a person's face. Deepfake detection seeks to recognize and differentiate such manipulations from actual videos or pictures.
This is a small project on real or fake processed photo recognition with 70-89% accuracy.

## General description
👩‍💻 Import any image with face, portrait mode.

🧠 The program will predict what this image is.

👯‍♀️ real photo or fake photo.

🤔 exclude all images except images with faces

💬 It takes about 5-10 seconds to get the result.

⚡️ Have a good day...
